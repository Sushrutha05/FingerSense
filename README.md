# FingerSense
FingerSense is a real-time webcam filter that detects when the middle finger is shown and applies a Gaussian blur over it for automatic censorship. It uses OpenCV and MediaPipe for hand tracking, with a gesture history voting system to ensure smooth, flicker-free detection and robust performance.
